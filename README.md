## Problem: Mars Rover

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.
A rover’s position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.
In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘M’. ‘L’ and ‘R’ makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. ‘M’ means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

### Input:
* The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower- left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
* The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover’s position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
* The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover’s orientation.
* Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won’t start to move until the first one has finished moving.
Output: The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

### Expected Output:
```

## Part 2 Extending the Problem

Since the plateau is rectangular and driving over the edge results in the rover plummeting to fiery destruction, a rover that moves off an edge of the plateau is lost forever. However, lost rovers leave a beacon in the dirt that prohibits future rovers from dropping off the edge at the same grid point.
The beacon is left at the last set of co-ordinates that the rover occupied before disappearing over the edge. An instruction to commit robotic suicide and move off the plateau from a grid point from which a rover has been previously lost is simply ignored by the current rover.
If a rover falls off the edge of the grid the acronym "RIP" should be printed after its last position and orientation.

### Test Input:
```
 5 5
 1 2 N
 LMLMLMLMM
 3 3 E 
MMRMMLMRRM 
4 1 S
 MLMLMRMRM
```
### Expected Output:
```
 1 3 N 
5 1 E RIP 
5 0 S
```

## Assumption

My solution is based on a few assumptions that are provided in the task info:
* The first line of input is the `upper-right coordinates of the plateau`, `the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0 ` - I will not be dealing with negative coordinates.
* `Each rover has two lines of input` - 1st line is rover's position, 2nd is instructions.
* `The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover’s orientation` - Hence why the example below works in this situation based on such assumption:
```
def parse_text
   read_file.each_slice(2).map do |(position, instructions)|
      x, y, direction = position.split(' ')
      new_position = [x.to_i, y.to_i, direction]
      new_instructions = instructions.split('')
      [new_position, new_instructions]
   end
end
```
* It's safe to assume that the last letter is between N, E, S or W since `rover spins 90 degrees left or right respectively`.

## Approach

### Initial Approach

* The `Input` class takes in a text file with the description of the mission, and then parses through the text file to extract useful/relevant information, ready for the `Controller` class to use.
* The `Controller` class then uses the inputs it receives to instruct each rover to follow.
* Once the `Rover` class is instantiated, it will use the inputs provided by the `Controller` to make the move.
*  There's a method that checks the position of the rover to ensure it does not go out of bound, according to the `upper-right coordinates of the plateau`, before it makes the next move. If it's heading out of bound, the execution of any consecutive instructions will stop, the rover will then return its current coordinates.
* Finally, once the mission has been completed each rover will return their final coordinates and in turn reports the results back to the `Controller`.

### Updated Approach

My initial approach was to do 3 classes as mentioned above.
* I have then created a Position class and Plateau class to rely less on primitives and extract some of the responsibilities from Controller to Plateau eg. check beacon exists and check if rover is out of bound, as these methods relates to the limit of the area of plateau rovers allow to pass.
* I have also moved some of the responsibilities from Rover class to Controller class.
* Makes methods private when possible.
* Write more smaller tests with shorter instructions.
* Improve naming in some of the methods and variables.
